# Overview of Google Tool files that we (plan to) use in our Make Scenario

## Google Sheet

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FMwGMlNTPc8CFFfNdhZp_MsaDrWU6xUNKLploQ60eD8/edit?usp=sharing
Spreadsheet where patient prescription data is stored. This spreadsheet contains one sheet per person
In full implementation this information should be stored securely, preferably in the Electronic Health Record of a patient , so patients can give access to doctors and pharmacies that they visit

## Google Forms

https://forms.gle/sa9RKmdLXjNyg4oU6
Medication interaction checking form

https://forms.gle/hp6rfQYjiRzu492NA
Prescription Form
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xP-jTlqB5-bax8qxv7f1s43OcnDquWo0AHF_OP_aLEc/edit?usp=sharing
Sheet where the Prescription Form responses go (and from there new rows should get send to the right patient sheet in the central database)



## Gmail

The email account dbp.pharmacy@gmail.com was created, and (so far attempted to) link in the scenario 
(OAuth setup seemed to work fine, but raised an error at the end, need to investigate)
