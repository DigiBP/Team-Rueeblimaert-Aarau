## Introduction

In Switzerland, drugs with medical promise are usually sold and handed over to the patient in pharmacies. Depending on the category of a drug, for selling and handing it over a prescription by a medical doctor is needed.

In our project, we focus on the interaction between the medical doctor in a practice or hospital who fill the drug presctiption and the pharmacy, as well as the process in the pharmacy where the prescription is checked and the required drug is eventually sold.

In todays common practice medical doctors and pharmacies both store the prescription information in their respective information systems which are not connected. Sending a prescription from a doctors practice to the pharmacy is mostly done via email or on paper. In addition, there is no common database containing the patients complete medication information.

in order to digitalize and improve this process, we implemented a common database in which a pharmacist can view the summary of a certain patient including a newly added prescription. At the same time, viewing this information allows to check reliably for eventual drug interactions.

## List of Assumptions

- To simplify our project the patient can only choose from two Pharmacies
-	Google form and google sheets are both secure and personal data will not leak
-	Our google sheet has the same function like a database

## Start of the Process:

In our digitalised Process, the Patient goes to a physician. If needed the medical doctor writes a prescription by filling out the [google form][1] (ten questions). Our BPN Process will be started as soon the physician sends the google form. In the Screenshots below there is an example of our google form.
