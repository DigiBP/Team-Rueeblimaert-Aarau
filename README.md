## Introduction

In Switzerland, Drugs with medical promise are sold and handed over to the patient in pharmacies. Depending on its category, for selling and handing over a drug in a pharmacy a prescription by a medical doctor is needed.

In our project, we focus on the interaction between the medical doctors in a medical practice or hospital who fill the drug presctiption and the pharmacy as well as the process in the pharmacy where the prescription is checked and the required drug is eventually sold.

In todays common practice medical doctors and pharmacies both store the prescription information in their respective information systems which are not connected. Sending a prescription from a doctors practice to the pharmacy is mostly done via email or on paper.






focusing on:
• Reduced prescription filling time
• Partially or fully automated service offerings through intelligent processes
• Efficient check of regulatory measures
• Improved integration with partners like hospitals and insurance companies
