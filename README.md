## Digital Pharmacy - use case

The swiss pharmacy and drug system is similar to systems in other countries, however, there are
some differences. In Switzerland, drugs defined as products having medicinal promise (e.g. «helps
against headache»), can exclusively be purchased in pharmacies, rarely in «Drogerien». In Switzerland, drugs are classified in several categories. The classification determines whether a product is
available over-the-counter (OTC) or if a prescription is needed: most drugs against mi-nor illnesses
or aches, for example, headaches or cough, can be purchased without a prescription. Several drugs
such as antibiotics, drugs against cancer or high dosage pain relievers can only be purchased with
a prescription from a medical doctor.
A typical pharmacy workflow follows the steps where a prescription is received by the pharmacy
personnel and ends with correct medication being handed over to the customer. Besides the prescription filling process, a pharmacy may offer several additional services like allergy checks, vaccinations, consultation, door-step delivery of products etc. Efficient pharmacy processes can improve
the way their customers are served, especially to senior members of the society as well as in pandemic situations.
Identify digitalization possibilities that would lead to a digital and smart pharmacy by focusing on:
• Reduced prescription filling time
• Partially or fully automated service offerings through intelligent processes
• Efficient check of regulatory measures
• Improved integration with partners like hospitals and insurance companies
